<P>The high frequency (HF) band, 3-30 MHz., has always been heavily used, with 
broadcast, mobile, fixed, maritime, aeronautical, and amateur allocations. 
Because of the worldwide propagation characteristics of HF, this band has proved 
to be very reliable and in some past emergency situations has been the only 
communications system available for contact with isolated groups of people. 
During times of national emergency, HF systems have proven to be critical 
elements of wireless communications. However reliable transmission in the HF 
band is complex: conditions change diurnally, seasonally, with solar conditions 
and with other ionospheric conditions. This complexity has necessitated an 
infrastructure of frequency planners, prediction programs, and simple 
trial-and-error methods to achieve the best results.</P>
<P>FED-STD-1045A, HF Radio Automatic Link Establishment (ALE), was developed to 
make HF radio operation simpler by automatically selecting the best frequency 
available for establishing a radio link. In an ALE system, the cooperating 
radios periodically send sounding signals over a range of operating frequencies. 
Each receiver scores each sound (or any other received ALE signal) and keeps 
track of the best frequencies at any given time. When a link to another radio is 
desired, the ALE system automatically selects the best frequency and establishes 
a connection through an automatic protocol. If a chosen frequency proves to be 
unusable, the ALE system will automatically and iteratively connect on the next 
best frequency. Once the connection has been made, any normal type of traffic 
(voice or data) can be passed. ALE radios allow faster connection times, more 
reliable connections, and simpler operation — and therefore a reduced 
requirement for skilled operators. ALE systems are currently being used 
successfully by many government and military organizations.</P>
<P>Despite its advantages, HF ALE has not been widely implemented by 
non-government users because of its relatively high equipment cost. There would 
be substantial benefits to the National Security and Emergency Preparedness 
(NS/EP) missions of the National Communications System (NCS) and other federal 
agencies if ALE technology could be made widely available. Coordination with ham 
radio operators in times of emergency has greatly enhanced previous disaster 
relief efforts. Broadening HF connectivity would speed future relief efforts. 
ITS is assisting NCS and its member agencies in achieving this goal by 
developing and demonstrating a low cost HF ALE capability for the personal 
computer (PC).</P>
<P>In order to make ALE techniques widely available, ITS has written an ALE 
controller program which runs on a standard PC in the Windows® environment. The 
PC connects to a standard (non-ALE) HF radio (at present only ICOM radios are 
supported) through a serial port for radio control and an audio cable for 
sending and receiving ALE tones. If the radio does not provide a voice-actuated 
switch function, this must be provided externally. The only special PC 
requirement is an audio card that is DirectX® compatible. The ALE controller 
program is multi-threaded. One thread provides an ALE tones modem and ALE word 
encoding and decoding. The other thread provides all other controller functions, 
such as user interface, configuration data manager, signal quality history, 
radio control, sounding, reception, scanning, connection, channel selection and 
Automatic Message Display interchange.</P>
<P>In the ALE signal, information is encoded by sending out tones which last 
eight milliseconds each. There are eight tones, so that each tone represents 
three bits (2<SUP>3</SUP> = 8) of information. The low-cost ALE modem uses a 
computer soundcard to sample these tones on input, and to reproduce them on 
output. In receive mode, the tones are sampled in overlapping four-millisecond 
windows, so that each tone is checked four times. A special digital filter, 
which is very robust against noise, is used to identify the tone in each window 
and a sophisticated pattern matching scheme is used to determine the identity of 
the sampled tone. This information is converted into a tone number between 0 and 
7 (three bits) and is passed to the decoding routine for further processing. The 
encoding routines send the transmit portion of the modem numbers from 0 to 7 and 
it produces an eight-millisecond long tone for each number that it receives. 
Both of these processes must occur in a real-time fashion, with no interruption 
from other programs, and so they depend very heavily upon threaded code 
techniques.</P>
