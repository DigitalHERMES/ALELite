This is the distribution for the ALE Lite program.  Please
note the following disclaimer:

     The software contained within was developed by an agency of the 
     U.S. Government. NTIA/ITS has no objection to the use of this
     software for any purpose since it is not subject to copyright 
     protection in the U.S.

     No warranty, expressed or implied, is made by NTIA/ITS or the U. S. 
     Government as to the accuracy, suitability and functioning of the 
     program and related material, nor shall the fact of distribution 
     constitute any endorsement by the U.S. Government.

The basic distribution consists of the executable for the ALE Lite 
program and for a Calibration program that is needed before running 
ALE Lite.  A help file is also included.  All of these files are in the 
Executable subdirectory.

The help file, ALE_Help.chm, should be executed (by double clicking 
on it) to get the installation instructions.

For those who are interested the source code for the program is 
included.  There is a separate source directory for the ALE Lite program, 
the Calibration program, and for the help file.  The Doc subdirectory 
has a documentation file, SWManual.doc, that is intended for 
programmers and is in Microsoft Word format.

Please note that this is a first version of this software.  It is not intended 
to be a polished, finished product.  We have had good luck using it 
in a laboratory environment, and we hope others will get some good 
value from using it.  The program has not been tested widely in 
real environments and may contain problems.  At this time we do 
not anticipate devoting any further resources toward the further 
development of this program, but perhaps others with interest may 
want to continue development with the supplied source code.

The equipment that the software has been tested on consists of
200 MHz Pentium Pro PCs with 64 Mb of RAM, Creative Ensoniq
AudioPCI sounds, DirectX 7, ICOM transceivers (IC-726 and IC-781) and
the Windows 98 SE operating system.
